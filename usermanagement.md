### **Rocky Linux User Management **  

Rocky Linux is a **RHEL-based** distribution that provides a stable and enterprise-grade operating system. **User management** in Rocky Linux involves adding, modifying, deleting users, managing groups, and controlling permissions.  

---

## **1. User Accounts in Rocky Linux**  
Each user account has a **username**, **UID (User ID)**, **GID (Group ID)**, **home directory**, and **shell**.  

### **Check Existing Users**  
Users are stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. To see all users:  
```bash
cat /etc/passwd

```

**Summary of /etc/passwd Output**

- **System Users:** root, bin, daemon, adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, mail, operator, games, and ftp are system/service accounts with /sbin/nologin or restricted shells.
- **Special Users:** nobody (used for unprivileged processes) and tss (for TPM access) have restricted access.
- **Regular User:** shri is a normal user with a home directory (/home/shri) and an interactive shell (/bin/bash).
  
To check a specific user:  
```bash
id username
```
[root@1309553fa3d7 /]# id shri
uid=1000(shri) gid=1000(shri) groups=1000(shri)
[root@1309553fa3d7 /]#

### **Check Logged-in Users**  
```bash
who  
w  
```
To check the last login of a user:  
```bash
last username
```

---

## **2. Creating a New User**  

### **Basic User Creation**  
```bash
sudo useradd username
```
- This creates a user but does not set a password.  
- The default home directory is `/home/username`.  
- The default shell is `/bin/bash`.  

### **Create User with Home Directory**  
```bash
sudo useradd -m username
```
The `-m` option ensures the home directory is created under `/home/username`.

### **Set Password for User**  
```bash
sudo passwd username
```
Users can also change their own password:  
```bash
passwd
```

---

## **3. Modifying User Accounts**  

### **Change User Home Directory**  
```bash
sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username
```

### **Change Username**  
```bash
sudo usermod -l newusername oldusername
```

### **Change User's Default Shell**  
```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh username
```
To list available shells:  
```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

### **Expire a User's Password (Force Password Change at Next Login)**  
```bash
sudo passwd -e username
```

---

## **4. Deleting a User**  

### **Delete a User (Without Deleting Home Directory)**  
```bash
sudo userdel username
```

### **Delete a User and Their Home Directory**  
```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

---

## **5. Group Management in Rocky Linux**  

### **Check All Groups**  
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

### **Create a New Group**  
```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

### **Add a User to a Group**  
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```
- `-aG`: Appends the user to a group without removing existing group memberships.

### **Remove a User from a Group**  
```bash
sudo gpasswd -d username groupname
```

### **Delete a Group**  
```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

### **Check Userâ€™s Group Membership**  
```bash
groups username
```
or  
```bash
id username
```

---

## **6. Managing User Privileges with Sudo**  

### **Grant a User Sudo Access**  
By default, Rocky Linux uses the `wheel` group for sudo access. Add a user to this group:  
```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel username
```

### **Grant Sudo Without Password (Edit Sudoers File)**  
```bash
sudo visudo
```
Add this line at the end:  
```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
This allows the user to execute any command without entering a password.

### **Remove Sudo Access**  
```bash
sudo deluser username wheel
```

---

## **7. Locking and Unlocking User Accounts**  

### **Lock a User Account**  
```bash
sudo usermod -L username
```
The user will not be able to log in.

### **Unlock a User Account**  
```bash
sudo usermod -U username
```

### **Disable Password Login for a User**  
```bash
sudo passwd -l username
```
This prevents the user from logging in but does not remove the account.

---

## **8. Managing User Expiration**  

### **Set an Expiry Date for a User**  
```bash
sudo chage -E YYYY-MM-DD username
```
For example, to expire a user on **December 31, 2025**:  
```bash
sudo chage -E 2025-12-31 username
```

### **Check User Account Expiration Information**  
```bash
sudo chage -l username
```

---

## **9. File Permissions & Ownership**  

### **Check File Permissions**  
```bash
ls -l filename
```

### **Change File Owner**  
```bash
sudo chown username:groupname filename
```

### **Change File Permissions**  
```bash
chmod 755 filename
```
- `7` â†’ Owner: Read, Write, Execute  
- `5` â†’ Group: Read, Execute  
- `5` â†’ Others: Read, Execute  

To **change directory permissions recursively**:  
```bash
chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory
```
